## Adafruit RGB LCD shield

I bought an [Adafruit RGB LCD
shield](https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-lcd-shield/using-the-rgb-lcd-shield)
a very, very long time ago.

For some stupid reason, I didn't use double headers like I
should have, so you can't connect anything else to the Arduino when
this shield is connected.

But you can just use male-to-female jumpers to connect four wires and
leave the rest open. You need A4, A5, V5, and the GND that is two to
the right of V5.
